<h1 class="section-title">Our Story</h1>

<div class="stories section" id="story1">
<p><img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="img/endor.jpg" />It was a beautiful day on the forest moon of Endor when the battle began between the clone army of the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. While attempting to take a strategic weapons supply post from the evil clutches of the Empire, two members of the Alliance met while fighting for their lives. Brought together by battle, they found that they were compatible and really kind of awesome.</p>

<p>Surrounded by the enemy, their cohort wounded, dead, or captured; they made the mutual decision that if they made it out of this alive, they were definitely getting together.</p>

<p>Having superior battle skills, the two soon-to-be lovebirds blasted their way through their captors until none were left. After a hot victory make-out session, they set a wedding date for September 13, 2014. They hope many of their fellow Alliance members and the Ewok peoples will be there for the celebration.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="section-title">Liar. What&#39;s the real story?</h3>

<div class="stories section" id="story2">
<p>Trey, a typical American teenager of the Eighties, was accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean &ldquo;time machine&rdquo; invented by a slightly mad scientist, Doc Brown. In his attempt to make certain his teenage parents-to-be meet and fall in love, he caught Kylie&#39;s eye and she convinced him to escort her to the &ldquo;Enchantment Under the Sea&rdquo; dance.</p>

<p>As the 1955 Doc Brown devised a way to harness an approaching electrical storm to supplant the nuclear energy needed for the time machine to return to 1985, Trey decided that even though it would create a host of time paradoxes, he could not live his life in the future without Kylie.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive pull-left" src="img/clocktower.jpg" />At precisely 10:04 PM on Saturday, November 12, 1955, Trey and Kylie loaded up the DeLorean, attached a conductive antenna and raced along Main Street at almost 90 MPH just as lightning struck the clock tower. The bolt surged through some makeshift electrical wiring and was directed straight into the DeLorean&#39;s flux capacitor. Doc&#39;s crazy plan worked!</p>

<p>Almost. The couple arrived not in 1985 as originally intended, but instead the year 2014. Time travel isn&#39;t perfect, you know.</p>

<p>Being unable to locate Doc in 2014, the pair decided to cut their losses and begin their lives anew in the 21st century.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="section-title">Pull the other one. Out with it, already!</h3>

<div class="stories section" id="actual-story">
<p>Okay, okay, fine.</p>

<p>We&#39;re an unusual couple. For us, there was no &ldquo;meet-cute&rdquo;. In fact, between the two of us, we have yet to pinpoint exactly when and what happened when we first met. What we do know is this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cynda (the matron of honor) is the only reason we met.</li>
	<li>Neither of us ever quite forgot the other.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s been eleven years of circling each others&#39; lives. A birthday party here, a random get-together there, somehow making mutual friends completely independent of the other. Neither of us willing to let the other drift completely out of our lives.</p>

<p>Our current circumstances arose out of a made-up holiday. After six months of gradually making our way back into each others&#39; lives, the fateful day known as Five Pies Friday took place. What followed was the consumption of an obscene amount of pie, a lecture on female behavior from well-meaning friends, and a ridiculous amount of texting.</p>

<p>After an excellent first date seeing The Hobbit (which neither of us were certain we should call a date), we spent the next month trying to figure out what we were doing. Neither of us were well-versed in the art of courtship. Finally, on January 29th 2013, in a text message (of course), it was decided that we WERE, in fact, dating.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="img/engagement-03.jpg" />And that was it. We were together.</p>

<p>In the past year, we&#39;ve taken trips together (San Francisco!), we&#39;ve celebrated holidays together, introduced our parents, and decided that we wanted to spend our lives together.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a long journey for us, but most of all it&#39;s been an eye-opening discovery that the person God meant for us was always there, right in front of us. We are amazed, liberated, and at peace with each other. We are in love.</p>

<p>And we can&#39;t wait to share that love with our friends and family this September!</p>
